I am a Linguistics M.A. student at Arizona State University interested in theoretical linguistics, computational cognitive science, and reasoning in both brains and machines. I will be applying to PhD programs, targeting a Fall 2025 start.

On the AI side, I currently work at the [Yochan lab](https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/) under [Subbarao Kambhampati](https://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/). My research is guided and inspired by the dual goals of teaching concepts to and distilling symbols from neural networks in human-interpretable form. Much of my work has focused on the much-hyped in-context learning abilities of large language models, especially as applied to classical reasoning and planning tasks.

In linguistics, I am studying models of phonological acquisition and evolution in the context of optimality theory and its extensions. My thesis advisor is [Kathryn Pruitt](https://sites.google.com/view/kathryn-pruitt/).

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, swimming, reading and writing fiction, participating in well-rendered cooperative multiagent simulations, and baking.
