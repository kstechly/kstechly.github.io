I am a Computer Science PhD at Yale interested in learning, computational cognitive science, and language-mediated reasoning in both brains and machines. Previously, I completed a Linguistics M.A. at Arizona State University where I was advised by [Kathryn Pruitt](https://sites.google.com/view/kathryn-prutt/) and worked in the [Yochan lab](https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/) under [Subbarao Kambhampati](https://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/).

My research is guided by the dual goals of teaching concepts to and distilling symbols from AI systems in human-interpretable form. Much of my work has focused on the investigating much-hyped in-context learning abilities of large language models, especially as applied to classical reasoning and planning tasks. I also work on leveraging the strengths of neural networks in representing tacit knowledge to improve the expressivity and efficiency of symbolic systems.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, reading and writing fiction, and baking.
