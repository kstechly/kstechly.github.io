I'm at [NeurIPS 2023](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023) together with [Karthik Valmeekam](https://karthikv792.github.io/) and [Lin Guan](https://guansuns.github.io/) from the [Yochan Lab](https://yochan-lab.github.io/). We'll be presenting [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12397), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08118), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10498), [4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14909), and [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15771), covering various facets of LLM planning and reasoning abilities (or lack thereof).
